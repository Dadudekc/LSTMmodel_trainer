# Validation Report

## Test Execution

- `pytest -q` â€“ all tests pass:

```
...                                                                      [100%]
3 passed in 0.02s
```

The tests stub heavy dependencies so they execute in a minimal environment and validate basic behaviour of `ModelTrainer` and module imports.

## Manual Checks

- Attempting to run `python LSTM_Model_Trainer` fails in this container due to missing packages (`pandas` etc.).
- Attempting to run `python src/main.py` fails because `PyQt5` is not installed.

## Observations

- Core logic is encapsulated in `ModelTrainer` and tested.
- GUI and LSTM script require external dependencies which are not present in this validation environment.
- Configuration file references dataset paths that are not included in the repository.

Overall the codebase is small and functional but depends on a Python environment with machine-learning libraries installed.
