# Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines upcoming milestones for the LSTM Model Trainer.

## v0.1 – Initial Release
- Basic GUI for loading datasets and training standard models.
- `ModelTrainer` module with preprocessing and evaluation utilities.
- Example LSTM training script.
- Minimal unit tests and documentation.

## v0.2 – Beta
- Improved error handling and logging in GUI and `ModelTrainer`.
- Support saving and loading trained models through the GUI.
- Cross-platform packaging instructions.
- Expanded tests for edge cases.

## v1.0 – Stable
- Polish user experience and provide more flexible hyperparameter settings.
- Optional hyperparameter tuning framework integration.
- Additional visualization tools (e.g., confusion matrices, loss curves).
- Continuous integration setup for automated testing.
